## What is Multi-Omics Data Integration?


## What is the problem?

Cancer has been implicated to be a major cause of death worldwide. The molecular alterations at different biological information processing levels contribute to the final phenotypic representations in cancer. As such, there is a need to understand the interaction effect of the various information layers, and how they are implicated in cancer onset, progression, and treatment. To solve this problem, we want to leverage the publicly available tumor/normal genomic dataset from TCGA to identify and integrate different omics. The outcome of this integration will then be tied to the clinical variables available from these sources. Finally, this integrated dataset will then be used to build a prediction/classifying  model.
